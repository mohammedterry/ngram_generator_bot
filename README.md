# ngram_generator_bot

"Ideally, a socialbot should be able to ingest and update its knowledge base automatically; however, this is an unsolved problem and an active area of research"...or is it?

same principles as ngram_generator project to generate sentences - but this time its training corpus is you! as you talk to it - the bot gets smarter and learns more ngrams which allows it to create better sentences.  the more you converse with it the more you teach it to talk (like a child).  Although its vocabulary is limited to the words it hears from you - It doesnt merely repeat back exactly what you say.  It experiments by combining the words in its own unique way - - - see the examples below

And after just a couple of minutes talking - the bot is able to have a very normal conversation without any scripted replies.  It simply learnt what to say in certain contexts by talking with me (trigram model)
