# ngram_generator_bot

same principles as ngram_generator project to generate sentences - but this time its training corpus is you! as you talk to it - the bot gets smarter and learns more ngrams which allows it to create better sentences.  the more you converse with it the more you teach it to talk (like a child).  Although its vocabulary is limited to the words it hears from you - It doesnt merely repeat back exactly what you say.  It experiments by combining the words in its own unique way - - - see the examples below
